# Library-Management-System

The Library System Management Web Application designed to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for managing library resources. The system allows users to view, search, and interact with a collection of books, while administrators can add, edit, or remove book records. This project is built as a frontend-based simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
